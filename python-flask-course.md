# Flask Web Development Course

In this course, we will be learning python web development using flask. We will build
a complete online store from scratch, covering front-end development, back-end development,
database interaction, and security in flask.

Requirements: A machine running Mac Os or Linux. Windows users should look into virtual machines
or installing a linux subsystem.

1. Virtual Environment Overview
	1. Check if you already have python 3 installed
	```
	python3 --version
	```
	```
	python --version
	```
	###### * If Either of these commands give a python version 3.6.1 or higher you will be set
